This is the repo of the config for the Phaser workshop that we hosted on Friday 20 November 2020 in the context of our formation with [BeCode](https://becode.org/).

## Get started

1) clone this repo

```git clone https://github.com/fwauters/workshop-phaser```

2) code your game in the game.js file

3) enjoy :grin:

## Got lost ?

The 'steps' folder contains several functional game.js files for each major step :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
